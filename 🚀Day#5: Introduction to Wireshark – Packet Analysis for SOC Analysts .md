📘 What is Wireshark?

Wireshark is an open-source network protocol analyser that lets you capture and interactively browse network traffic. It allows analysts to view data packets flowing in and out of a system in real time or from saved PCAP files.

🛡️ Wireshark Use Cases for SOC Analysts

🔍 Incident Investigation: Analyse malicious traffic patterns (e.g., C2 communication, lateral movement)
🕵️ Malware Analysis: Extract indicators like domains, IPs, and payloads from suspicious network behaviour
🚨 Threat Hunting: Detect anomalies like DNS tunnelling, beaconing, or unauthorised FTP/SSH usage
🛠️ Protocol Troubleshooting: Identify service failures, misconfigurations, or latency issues

# 30-Day-SOC-Analyst-Challenge-2025
his repository documents my progress through a 30-day hands-on challenge, designed to build and showcase essential SOC Analyst skills for job readiness. Each day features a focused lab or task to deepen understanding and practical expertise in cybersecurity operations.

# üöÄDay#9: Wireshark Basics ‚Äì TLS Protocol Analysis


## üéØ Objective
The objective of this lab is to help analyze TLS (Transport Layer Security) traffic using Wireshark, will explore how TLS secures data over the network, understand key handshake messages, and identify crucial metadata such as server names and certificate details. This analysis is vital for a SOC Analyst to identify potential security anomalies or misconfigurations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Lab Setup

### System Requirements

Operating System: Windows 10/11 (or Linux/macOS)

Software: Wireshark (latest version recommended)

## üìò TLS Packet Structure and Fields

TLS is a cryptographic protocol that provides secure communication over the internet. It operates over TCP, commonly on port 443 (for HTTPS), but is also used in other secure protocols like FTPS and SMTPS. Understanding the TLS handshake is fundamental for network security analysis.

Key TLS Handshake Messages:

Message Type

Description

Client Hello

Client initiates a secure connection and offers supported cipher suites.

Server Hello

Server selects a cipher suite from the client's offer and provides its certificate.

Certificate

Server provides its digital certificate (X.509) for authentication.

Key Exchange

Client and server securely exchange cryptographic keys for the session.

Finished

Both parties confirm the handshake is complete, and the secure session begins.

## üîç Most Common TLS Display Filters

Use these filters in Wireshark‚Äôs Display Filter bar to analyze TLS traffic effectively:

Filter

Description

tls

Show all TLS traffic

tcp.port == 443

TLS over HTTPS (standard port)

tls.handshake.type == 1

Client Hello messages (start of handshake)

tls.handshake.type == 2

Server Hello messages (response to Client Hello)

tls.record.version == 0x0303

TLS 1.2 traffic (specific version)

tls.record.version == 0x0304

TLS 1.3 traffic (specific version)

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

TLS secures communication using encryption, making network traffic unreadable to unauthorized parties without the proper keys.

While Wireshark cannot decrypt encrypted TLS traffic by default (without pre-shared keys or private keys), it can still reveal crucial metadata such as:

Server Name Indication (SNI)

Certificate chain details

Negotiated TLS versions and cipher suites

Analyzing TLS metadata helps SOC Analysts detect:

Use of outdated or insecure TLS versions (e.g., TLS 1.0/1.1).

Suspicious or self-signed certificates that might indicate a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack.

Malicious domains abusing encryption for command-and-control (C2) communication.

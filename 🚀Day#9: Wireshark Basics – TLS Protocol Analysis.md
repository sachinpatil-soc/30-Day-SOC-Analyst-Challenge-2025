# üöÄDay#9: Wireshark Basics ‚Äì TLS Protocol Analysis


## üéØ Objective

The objective of this lab is to analyse TLS (Transport Layer Security) traffic using Wireshark. will explore how TLS secures data over the network, understand handshake messages, and identify metadata like server names and certificate details.

## üõ†Ô∏è Lab Setup

### System Requirements

Operating System: Windows 10/11 (or Linux/macOS)
Software: Wireshark (latest version)
Files Needed



TLS is a cryptographic protocol that provides secure communication over the internet. It runs over TCP, commonly on port 443, and is used in HTTPS, FTPS, SMTPS, etc.

### Key TLS Handshake Messages:

Message Type	Description
Client Hello	Client initiates secure connection, offers cipher suites
Server Hello	Server selects cipher and provides certificate
Certificate	Server provides digital certificate (X.509)
Key Exchange	Client and server exchange keys for session
Finished	Secure session begins


## üîç Most Common TLS Display Filters

Use these filters in Wireshark‚Äôs Display Filter bar to analyze TLS traffic:

Filter

Description

tls

Show all TLS traffic

tcp.port == 443

TLS over HTTPS (standard port)

tls.handshake.type == 1

Client Hello messages (start of handshake)

tls.handshake.type == 2

Server Hello messages (response to Client Hello)

tls.record.version == 0x0303

TLS 1.2 traffic (specific version)

tls.record.version == 0x0304

TLS 1.3 traffic (specific version)


## ‚úÖ Conclusion

TLS secures communication using encryption, making traffic unreadable without keys.

Wireshark can't decrypt TLS by default but can reveal:

Server name (SNI)

Certificate chain

TLS versions and cipher suites

Analyzing TLS metadata helps detect:

Outdated TLS versions (e.g., TLS 1.0)

Suspicious or self-signed certificates

Malicious domain encryption abuse

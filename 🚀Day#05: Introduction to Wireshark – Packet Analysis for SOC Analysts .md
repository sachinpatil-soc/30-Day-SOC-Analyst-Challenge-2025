# 30-Day-SOC-Analyst-Challenge-2025
This repository documents my progress through a 30-day hands-on challenge, designed to build and showcase essential SOC Analyst skills for job readiness. Each day features a focused lab or task to deepen understanding and practical expertise in cybersecurity operations.

# Day#05: Introduction to Wireshark – Packet Analysis for SOC Analysts

## 🎯 Objective

The objective of this lab is to introduce about Wireshark, a powerful packet analysis tool used by SOC analysts to investigate network traffic. will learn the interface, how to capture packets, apply filters, and identify suspicious communication patterns.



## 🛠️ Lab Setup

## System Requirements

Operating System: Windows, Linux, or macOS
Network Adapter: Required for packet capture
Software Required

Wireshark (latest stable version)
Download Sample PCAP file

## 📘 What is Wireshark?

Wireshark is an open-source network protocol analyser that lets you capture and interactively browse network traffic. It allows analysts to view data packets flowing in and out of a system in real time or from saved PCAP files.

### 🛡️ Wireshark Use Cases for SOC Analysts

🔍 Incident Investigation: Analyse malicious traffic patterns (e.g., C2 communication, lateral movement)
🕵️ Malware Analysis: Extract indicators like domains, IPs, and payloads from suspicious network behaviour
🚨 Threat Hunting: Detect anomalies like DNS tunnelling, beaconing, or unauthorised FTP/SSH usage
🛠️ Protocol Troubleshooting: Identify service failures, misconfigurations, or latency issues

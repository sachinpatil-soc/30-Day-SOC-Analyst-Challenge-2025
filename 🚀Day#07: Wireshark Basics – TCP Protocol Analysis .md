# 30-Day-SOC-Analyst-Challenge-2025

This repository documents my progress through a 30-day hands-on challenge, designed to build and showcase essential SOC Analyst skills for job readiness. Each day features a focused lab or task to deepen understanding and practical expertise in cybersecurity operations.

# 🚀Day#07: Wireshark Basics – TCP Protocol Analysis

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this lab is to introduce students to analyzing **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** traffic using **Wireshark**. Students will learn how TCP establishes connections, the 3-way handshake process, and how to interpret common TCP fields and flags.

## 🛠️ Lab Setup

### **System Requirements**
- **Operating System:** Windows 10/11 (or Linux/macOS)
- **Software:** Wireshark (latest version)

### **Files Needed**
- [Download Sample PCAP file](https://github.com/0xrajneesh/90-Days-SOC-Challenge-Beginner/raw/refs/heads/main/Protocol_Analysis_pcap.pcapng)

## 📘 **TCP Packet Structure and Fields**

TCP is a **Layer 4 (Transport Layer)** protocol that ensures reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between applications.

### **Key TCP Fields:**

| Field Name         | Description                                  |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Source Port**     | Sender’s port number                         |
| **Destination Port**| Receiver’s port number                       |
| **Sequence Number** | Number of the first byte in the segment      |
| **Acknowledgment No** | Confirms received data                    |
| **Flags**           | Control bits (SYN, ACK, FIN, RST, PSH, URG) |
| **Window Size**     | Buffer size available                        |
| **Checksum**        | Error-checking field                         |

## 🔍 **Most Common TCP Display Filters**

Use these filters in Wireshark’s **Display Filter** bar:

| Filter                  | Description                              |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `tcp`                   | Show all TCP packets                     |
| `tcp.flags.syn == 1`    | Show SYN packets (start of connection)   |
| `tcp.flags.fin == 1`    | Show FIN packets (end of connection)     |
| `tcp.port == 80`        | Show TCP packets on port 80              |
| `ip.addr == 192.168.1.1`| TCP traffic to/from a specific host      |

## ✅ Conclusion
- TCP ensures reliable and ordered data delivery through its 3-way handshake and flow control.
- Understanding TCP flags is essential for:
 - Connection state tracking
 - Troubleshooting dropped or reset connections
 - Detecting scanning and abnormal behavior (e.g., RST floods)

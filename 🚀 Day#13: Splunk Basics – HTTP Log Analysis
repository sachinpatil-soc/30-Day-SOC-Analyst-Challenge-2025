🚀 Day#13/ Splunk Basics – HTTP Log Analysis

🎯 Objective

In this lab will Learn how to ingest and analyse HTTP logs using Splunk.
Detect client errors, server errors, and suspicious web activity.
Identify large file transfers and suspicious URI access attempts.

🖥️ Lab Setup
✅ Splunk: Already installed and accessible.
✅ Data Source: JSON-formatted Zeek-style HTTP logs.
🌐 Log File: Download and upload to Splunk using the steps below.
📥 Download HTTP Log file

⚙️ Steps to Upload HTTP Log into Splunk

Go to Splunk Web → Settings > Add Data.
Choose Upload and select synthetic_zeek_http.json.
Set Source type: json or create a new one zeek:http.
Index: Choose main or create a new index like http_lab.
Finish the upload and confirm indexing.
🔍 Lab Tasks

Use SPL queries to complete the following analysis:

✅ Task 1: Find the top 10 endpoints generating web traffic

index=http_lab sourcetype="json"
| stats count by "id.orig_h"
| sort -count
| head 10
✅Task 2: Count the number of server errors (5xx) observed

index=http_lab sourcetype="json" status_code>=500 status_code<600
| stats count as server_errors
✅Task 3: Identify User-Agents associated with possible scripted attacks

index=http_lab sourcetype="json" user_agent IN ("sqlmap/1.5.1", "curl/7.68.0", "python-requests/2.25.1", "botnet-checker/1.0")
| stats count by user_agent
✅Task 4: Find large file transfers (greater than 500 KB)

index=http_lab sourcetype="json" resp_body_len>500000
| table ts "id.orig_h" "id.resp_h" uri resp_body_len
| sort -resp_body_len
